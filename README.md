# panzoom-positioning-image-center

Panzoom is Qjuery image viewer with zoom: https://github.com/timmywil/jquery.panzoom


Download all the repository, open file `demo-min.html` in your browser.


I've managed to make panzoom position image at center, scaled to the page size. I've added big borders and backgrounds to indicate positions of different elements. However, "Reset" button is not working properly at the moment. Also buttons are fixed and the bottom of the page, but I think the one who wants can move them where it is needed.
